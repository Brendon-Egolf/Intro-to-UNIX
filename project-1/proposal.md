# Hospital Server Infrastructure Proposal

Server Hardware Requirements
----------------------------

### Blade Requirements

- 12 cpus 3 Ghz on each cpu

- 500 gb RAM

- Three Cisco blades will be purchased to meet these requirements

### Storage Requirements

- 32 Terabytes for all data

- Nexus switch to communicate between the vm and the SAN

### Uninterruptible Power Supply

- 2 10kW Uninterruptible power supplies, 1 for continuous use, and another for backup
## Server Virtualisation

Each server will run on chassis server system using server blades and use VMWare to run
all servers
## Disaster Recovery

- All data on the server will be backed up on tape every week

- This tape will be secured and stored for a total of one year before being degaussed

Fire Detection/Suppression/Prevention
-------------------------------------

### Detection

- The server room will have a smoke detector above each piece of equipment

- Audible alarms will trigger before the gas suppression system begins

- Warning signs will be place on the door during gas release points

- Venting will be used to keep neutral pressure during gas discharge

- There will be a smoke detector in every room, ceiling, and floor void throughout the
  building


### Suppression

- An inert gas fire suppression system will be used in the server room

- A fire suppression control panel will be placed in the server room

- All fire suppression systems will be place on backup power, and have internal backup
  batteries

### Prevention

- Intumescent sealant will be placed in all openings in walls

- Fireproof materials will be preferred for all materials when purchased

- Plenum cable will be used in all HVAC spaces

HVAC
----

- Two 3.3 refrigeration ton HVAC systems will be used to control temperature and humidity
  in the server room

- These will both be connected to backup power and the second HVAC system will work to
  compensate for the failed system

- These HVAC systems will also control humidity in the server room.

- At normal operating conditions, each HVAC system will run at 50% capacity

Physical Security
-----------------

### Video Cameras

- A video system will be used in the server room, cameras will monitor all access points
  to the server, and the server itself at all times.

- These will be placed on backup power to ensure that the system functions in the event
  of a loss of power

### Visitors

- A laptop will be set up with an entry/exit log form for visitors to sign in and out on to
  ensure security.

- Visitors must also wear id and be escorted by personnel at all times

### Structural Security

- The server room will be place near the center of the building, and will be on the third
  floor

- Doors will be 4ft wide and 8ft tall

- Door hinges will be inside of the room

- The ceiling of the room will be 10 feet tall

- There will be greater than 4ft of clearance around each server racks

- The floor will be raised by 2 feet

### Power

- There will be a dedicated circuit for all equipment, along with 3 more circuits for
  backup

- All server equipment will be powered by a UPS and the UPS will be backed up by an
  emergency generator

- Emergency lighting will be placed in the server room


### Security

- Keypad locked steel doors will be used for the server room

- The manager of the server room will maintain an inventory of all systems in the server
  room

- There will be no sign on the server room to avoid the attraction of unecessary
  attention or attack





## Server Virtualisation

Each server will run on chassis server system using server blades and use VMWare to run
all servers
